# load-balancer
Trying out new things. Learning Go. Balancing loads ðŸ¤‘

## architecture planning

Basic idea: we want to have some sort of web service, where requests are recieved, sent to a shared queue, and then handled accordingly

Questions:
* When to spin up a new container
* What metrics should we send to frontend?

Working on:
* When to spin up new docker containers?

Future ideas:
* Websocket connection to frontend for live monitoring?
  * Tauri app?
* Configure this to allow users to upload their own docker images?
* Add rate tracking?
* Re-implement shared queue

### general thoughts
  
We need loops (within goroutines) for:
* adding to shared queue
* removing from queue and distributing to servers

Goroutines for:
* Checking node health
* Spinning up new docker container instances

Proxy process:
* Dequeue a connection
* Pick a node to send it to (configure this to allow for multiple balancing strategies)
  * This requires the balancer internal data structure to be modified
    * Hash table for 'address: { node, connectionData }' pairs
  * Balancing options
    * Round robin
    * least connections (weighted)
    * compute based
    * IP hash

Things to research:
* Good load balancing algorithms / strategies
  * At what point do we decide to spin up a new instance
  * How do we decide which instance to send requests to?

### frontend thoughts
* Communicate to the backend with websockets
  * Backend shoots logs to the frontend
  * Logs + metrics about responses
* Allow for user to manually start / update nodes
